# Alexa-Google-Doc-Viewer
This is a Alexa skill myself and ChatGPT helped me work on. Basically, I wanted the ability to digitally store all of my wife's recipes in Google Drive and view them on an Echo Show device in our kitchen. I wanted to do this without using the building in Silk browser on the Echo Show (which isn't great) Thought this code may help someone out.
